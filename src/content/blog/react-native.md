Hey everyone! 👋 Shane Jeremich here again, and today I want to share my experiences with **React Native**, a framework that allows developers to build mobile applications using **React**. Recently, I’ve been on a journey to transition my movies application, which I initially built and deployed using **VITE**, into a mobile app using React Native. Spoiler alert: it hasn’t been easy! But it’s been an incredible learning experience that’s pushing me beyond my comfort zone. Let’s dive into what React Native is and how my journey has been so far.

## What is React Native? 🤔

**React Native** is an open-source framework developed by Facebook that enables developers to build mobile applications using **JavaScript** and **React**. Unlike traditional methods where you might need to learn different languages for Android and iOS, React Native allows you to write your application in JavaScript and render it using native components. This means you can create truly native apps that have the look and feel of native apps on both Android and iOS platforms, all while using the knowledge you already have from working with React.

### In simple terms:

- React Native allows you to build mobile apps using JavaScript and React.
- It lets you create apps that work on both Android and iOS with a single codebase.
- You can reuse components and logic between web and mobile, which speeds up development.

## My Experience with React Native 🛠️

As someone who has primarily worked with web technologies, diving into mobile development with React Native has been both exciting and challenging. Here’s how it’s been going:

### The Setup Struggle: A Rocky Start 🚧

The first hurdle I encountered was getting the React Native environment set up. Coming from a **VITE** background, where setting up a project is usually straightforward, React Native felt like a completely different beast. From installing the required packages to configuring the environment, I found myself facing error after error. Every step forward felt like two steps back, but I knew this was part of the learning process.

### The Conversion Challenge: Web to Mobile 🔄

One of the main reasons I wanted to learn React Native was to convert my existing web application into a mobile app. I thought this would be a smooth transition, given my experience with React, but I quickly learned that mobile development comes with its own set of challenges. The UI components, navigation patterns, and even the way data is managed can differ significantly from web development.

I’ve been using **Expo Router** to handle navigation in my app, but getting the tabs to work correctly has been a struggle. On the web, routing is straightforward with React Router, but in React Native, there’s a learning curve—especially when trying to mimic the tab navigation experience on mobile. I’ve been following the documentation closely, but it’s been a lot of trial and error.

### Using Expo Go: A Vital Tool for Development 🚀

To help with the development process, I’ve been using **Expo Go**. But what exactly is Expo Go, and why is it essential?

**Expo Go** is a mobile app provided by the Expo framework that allows you to preview and test your React Native projects on your actual device without needing to build a full native binary (APK or IPA) every time you make a change. This is incredibly useful because it streamlines the development process, allowing you to see changes in real-time as you write your code.

Here’s why **Expo Go** is such a valuable tool:

- **Quick Feedback Loop:** Expo Go provides an almost instant preview of your app on a physical device or emulator, so you can see how your changes affect the app without the need to wait for a full build.
- **Cross-Platform Testing:** You can easily test your app on both Android and iOS devices using the same Expo Go app, ensuring that your app behaves consistently across platforms.
- **Ease of Use:** It simplifies the testing process, especially for someone like me who is new to mobile development. You don’t need to worry about setting up complex build environments or dealing with native code—Expo Go handles the heavy lifting.

Using Expo Go has been a game-changer in my development process, allowing me to focus more on coding and less on the intricacies of building and deploying the app during development.

### Facing the Errors: A Lesson in Patience 🧘‍♂️

If there’s one thing that React Native has taught me so far, it’s patience. The number of errors I’ve encountered—some of which took hours to debug—has been overwhelming. But with each error, I’ve been able to improve my troubleshooting skills, learning to dig deeper into documentation, community forums, and GitHub issues to find solutions. It’s frustrating, but it’s also incredibly rewarding when things finally start to work.

### Stepping Out of My Comfort Zone: Embracing the Challenge 🏋️‍♂️

Despite the challenges, I’m grateful for the experience because it’s pushing me out of my comfort zone. I’m learning to adapt to new tools and methodologies that are essential for mobile development. This journey is teaching me more than just React Native—it’s enhancing my problem-solving abilities, making me more resilient, and helping me become a more versatile developer.

## Why I’ll Keep Pushing Forward 🌱

Even though this journey has been tough, I’m determined to keep going. Here’s why:

- **New Skills:** Learning React Native is adding a whole new set of skills to my developer toolkit. It’s exciting to think about the possibilities that come with being able to build both web and mobile applications.
- **Versatility:** Being able to transition from web to mobile makes me more versatile as a developer. It opens up new opportunities and allows me to take on more complex projects in the future.
- **Community Support:** The React Native community is huge and supportive. There’s always someone who has faced a similar issue, and the wealth of resources available online is a great help.
- **The End Goal:** I’m motivated by the idea of seeing my movies app come to life on a mobile device. The end result will be worth all the struggles I’ve faced along the way.

## Final Thoughts 💭

Transitioning from web development to mobile with React Native has been one of the most challenging experiences of my development journey so far. But with every challenge comes growth, and I’m excited to continue pushing myself to learn more and overcome the obstacles in my way. If you’re thinking about diving into React Native, just know that it won’t be easy, but it will definitely be worth it.

Thanks for joining me on this journey. Stay tuned for more updates as I continue to explore and learn new technologies. 🚀📱
